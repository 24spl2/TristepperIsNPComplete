# TristepperIsNPComplete
Though the little man of goo may be intimidating, he is indeed only NP hard


//This is not a coding project, but a Theory Paper//

He is neon pink, He shoots goo balls, and He is new in town! (At least on CoolMathGames)

My team and I instantly fell in love with this little goo man, and we wanted to prove that he is not so tough. He is only NP tough :)

We noticed that his terrain was a bit like a Hamiltonian Grid Graph Path, so we used a reduciton to that as our source problem.
After about 30 different "gadget" creations to relate Hamiltonian Grid Graph to Tristepper, I finally created the one. Our gadget used the Tristepper rules and created set tunnels that acted as nodes and paths in a Hamiltonian Grid Graph.
